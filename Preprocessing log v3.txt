DATETIME used for days one hot encoded for power usage, and also made cyclical values for power production
RRP values outside of 95th percentile trimmed (negative values and values over 400 are uncommon, up to -1000 and 15000 and are not useful data)

'WEEKDAY_SIN', 'WEEKDAY_COS'

Can do but might be unnecessary:
Binary for weekend (may overfit and not be necessary due to one-hot encoding of weekdays)
Binary for day/night (may overfit as irradiance already contains this info) 
Binary for raining (may overfit as precipitation already contains this info)
